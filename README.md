## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was my first time working with Tailwind CSS. I learned how to use the utility classes provided by the framework, but also how to customize them and create my own variables.

I love turning designs into code and matching layouts as closely as possible to the original mockups â€” and I found that Tailwind CSS is especially well-suited for that. It's a different way of working, since you rarely leave your HTML file, but it's actually very enjoyable! I appreciated how fast it was to implement a design.
